      </div>

      <div id="section-1-1">
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; font-size:18px;"> 1.1. Overview of OSA </h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:16px;"> <b>Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)</b> is a sleep disorder characterised by repeated episodes of partial (hypopnoea) or complete (apnoea) upper airway blockage (Fig. 1), due to relaxation of airway muscles during sleep [1]. As these muscles relax, the airway narrows or collapses, obstructing airflow and reducing oxygen levels in the blood [2]. This forces the body to exert extra effort to reopen the airway, often causing gasping or abrupt awakenings as breathing resumes. </p>
        <image-component
          tag="image"
          source="assets/Figure1.png"
          subtitle=""

        <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 15px;"> Fig. 1: Upper Airway Obstruction Pattern. Obtained from [3]. </div>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:16px;"> These repeated interruptions interfere with restorative sleep and oxygen supply to vital organs, leading to excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and cognitive impairments. Many individuals with OSA experience loud and frequent snoring, choking episodes, and poor-quality sleep, often accompanied by symptoms such as morning headaches, dry mouth, and reduced daytime concentration [4]. </p>
      </div>

      <br />

      <div id="section-1-2">
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; font-size:18px;"> 1.2. Risk Factors for OSA </h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:16px;"> The development and severity of OSA are influenced by a combination of anatomical and non-anatomical factors that affect airway patency and collapsibility (Table 1). These factors interact to increase airway resistance, predisposing individuals to repeated airway obstruction during sleep. </p>
        <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 15px;"> Table 1: Risk Factors for OSA [1, 4, 5]. </div>

        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; font-size:18px;"> 1.3. Complications of OSA </h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:16px;"> Untreated OSA has wide-ranging consequences on health and daily functioning, including: </p>
        <ul>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Cardiovascular Complications:</b> Repeated oxygen deprivation and sleep disruption increase the risk of hypertension, heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. Studies suggest that 50-70 percent of stroke patients [6] and 30-50 percent of hypertensive patients have OSA [7], highlighting its strong association with cardiovascular disease. </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Metabolic Effects:</b> OSA exacerbates insulin resistance and diabetes, as intermittent hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) disrupts glucose metabolism [8]. </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Cognitive and Mental Health Impairments:</b> Chronic sleep disruption is linked to an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and memory decline [9]. </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Increased Accident Risk:</b> Excessive daytime sleepiness leads to a sevenfold increase in motor vehicle accidents [10] and twofold increase in workplace injuries due to decreased alertness and impaired reaction times [11]. </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Reduced Quality of Life:</b> Persistent fatigue, mood disturbances, and cognitive decline can impact work performance, social interaction, and overall well-being [12]. </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:16px;"> These complications highlight the need for early detection and effective management of OSA to prevent long-term health consequences. </p>

      <div id="section-1-4">
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; font-size:18px;"> 1.4. OSA Diagnosis and Severity Levels </h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:16px"> The gold standard for diagnosing OSA is <b>polysomnography (PSG)</b>, an overnight in-laboratory sleep study that records multiple physiological parameters, including brain wave activity, heart rate, and oxygen levels [5]. PSG provides a comprehensive assessment of sleep disturbances and enables healthcare providers to determine the severity of OSA using the <b>Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI)</b> – the number of apnoeic and hypopneic episodes per hour of sleep (Table 2) [2]. </p>
        <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 15px;"> Table 2: Severity Grading of OSA [13]. </div>

          id="table2">
        </image-component>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> While PSG offers detailed data, <b>Home Sleep Test (HST)</b> provides a more accessible alternative for OSA diagnosis. HSTs use portable devices (e.g. wearable monitors, disposable devices) to monitor key sleep parameters in a home setting. Although HSTs are less comprehensive than PSG, they offer a cost-effective and convenient option for patients with high pre-test probability of OSA [5]. </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> OSA is a significant global health concern, affecting an estimated 1 billion people worldwide, including 425 million adults aged 30-69 with moderate to severe OSA [1]. In Singapore, data from the Singapore Health Study suggests that 30.5 percent of the population may suffer from moderate to severe OSA [4]. Despite its high prevalence, more than 85 percent of OSA cases worldwide remain undiagnosed, leaving many individuals unaware of their condition and its associated health risks [14]. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> The increasing rates of obesity and ageing populations, both key risk factors for OSA, suggests that the prevalence of OSA will continue to rise [15]. This underscores the need for greater awareness, earlier detection, and more accessible treatment options to mitigate its impact on public health. </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Managing OSA requires a multidisciplinary approach, with specialists collaborating to tailor treatment plans based on patient needs. Various treatment modalities address airway obstruction through different mechanisms, each with distinct benefits and limitations. This section reviews commonly used OSA treatment, focusing on how they maintain an open airway and improve patient outcomes. </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Non-positional sleep therapies manage airway obstruction without relying on the patient’s sleeping position. These treatments work by improving airflow, modifying muscle tone, or physically altering airway structure to prevent collapse during sleep. Common approaches include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, and pharmacological interventions, each offering unique advantages and varying degrees of effectiveness depending on OSA severity and patient suitability. </p>

      <div id="section-2-1-1">
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size:18px;"> 2.1.1. CPAP Therapy </h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> CPAP therapy is the gold standard and most effective treatment for OSA [1]. It works by delivering a continuous stream of pressurised air through a mask (Fig. 2), preventing airway collapse and ensuring uninterrupted breathing during sleep [4, 16]. </p>

        <ul>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Mask:</b> Covers either the nose, mouth, or both, delivering pressurised air </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Straps:</b> Secure the mask comfortably on the face </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Tube:</b> Connects the mask to the motor, delivering airflow </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Motor:</b> Generates and regulates air pressure to keep the airway open </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Air Filter:</b> Remove impurities from the air before inhalation </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> Some CPAP machines include advanced features like heated humidifiers to minimise airway dryness and adjustable pressure settings to improve comfort </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Long-term CPAP use significantly reduces apnoea episodes, snoring, and associated health risks (e.g. hypertension, heart disease, stroke) [5]. It also enhances cognitive function, memory, and overall sleep quality [2, 16]. Many patients report increased energy levels and improved daytime alertness, with some experiencing noticeable benefits after the first use, while others require a few weeks of consistent use to adapt [4]. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Despite its effectiveness, CPAP adherence remains a major challenge due to discomfort and side effects [4, 16]. A Singapore study found that out of 751 patients who underwent a 1-month CPAP trial, only 44.9 percent adhered to therapy (Table 4) [17]. </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Barriers to adherence include [4, 16, 17]: </p>
        <ul>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Discomfort:</b> Mask-related issues (e.g. air leaks) and difficulty adjusting </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Cost:</b> High price of CPAP machines limits access for some patients </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Inconvenience:</b> Travel and maintenance requirements discourage long-term use </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Poor Disease Perception:</b> Some patients underestimate the severity of OSA or switch to alternative treatments </li>

      <div id="section-2-1-2">
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size:18px;"> 2.1.2. Oral Appliances </h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Oral Appliances (OAs) or dental splints provide an alternative treatment for OSA patients who struggle with CPAP therapy. Resembling removable braces or mouthguards, these devices work by repositioning the lower jaw slightly forward, helping to keep the airway open during sleep (Fig. 4) [4]. </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> OAs are generally easier to use and better tolerated than CPAP, with adherence rates estimated at 80-90 percent (compared to CPAP’s 50-70 percent) [15]. This makes them a viable option for patients with mild to moderate OSA or poor CPAP tolerance [5]. Other key benefits include: </p>
        <ul>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Compact and portable design</b>, making them convenient for travel </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Quiet operation</b>, unlike CPAP machines </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>No power source required</b>, reducing maintenance complexity </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> However, OAs come with certain drawbacks [4]: </p>
        <ul>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Side Effects:</b> Common issues include drooling, dry mouth, jaw discomfort, and minor tooth movement </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Effectiveness depends on severity:</b> OAs may become less effective with weight gain or worsening OSA and typically require replacement every 3-5 years </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Oral Health:</b> Proper dental hygiene is crucial to prevent cavities, gum disease, and tooth loosening. Patients with existing dental issues (e.g. unstable fillings, crowns) may need corrective dental work before using an OA, as teeth serve as anchors for the device. </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Titration Period:</b> A 4-6 month adjustment period may be needed to fine-tune the appliance’s position for optimal effectiveness </li>
        </ul>

      <div id="section-2-1-3">
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size:18px;"> 2.1.3. Surgery </h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Surgical intervention is considered a last resort for OSA when other treatments, including behavioural and lifestyle modifications, have proven ineffective. It may also be recommended for patients with structural abnormalities of the upper airway that can be surgically corrected. The goal of surgery is to widen the airway and reduce collapsibility, improving airflow and reducing obstruction. This is achieved by removing or repositioning excess tissue in the upper airway through procedures like tonsillectomy, septoplasty, and tracheostomy. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Since OSA varies between individuals, a standardised surgical approach is rarely effective. Instead, treatment must be tailored to the patient’s unique airway anatomy and obstruction site(s). A thorough pre-surgical evaluation, including drug-induced sleep endoscopy and imaging studies, is crucial for pinpointing the exact location of the obstruction. In some cases, a combination of procedures may be required to optimise results. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> While surgery can be effective, it is invasive, costly, and requires a prolonged recovery period. Potential challenges include: </p>
        <ul>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Post-Surgical Complications:</b> Pain, bleeding, infection, or difficulty swallowing </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Residual Symptoms:</b> Snoring or partial symptom recurrence over time </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Relapse of OSA:</b> Some patients may experience a return of symptoms, requiring additional interventions </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> To maintain the benefits of surgery, patients may need adjunct therapies, such as: </p>
        <ul>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Weight management</b> to prevent airway narrowing </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Dental appliances</b> to support post-surgical airway stability </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;"> <b>Continued CPAP therapy</b> in cases of persistent OSA symptoms </li>
        </ul>

      <div id="section-2-2">
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; font-size:18px;"> 2.2. Positional Sleep Therapy </h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Positional sleep therapy targets sleeping posture as a modifiable factor in managing OSA. For individuals with positional OSA, airway collapse is significantly more frequent when sleeping on the back (supine position) compared to side-sleeping. By encouraging a side-sleeping posture, these therapies aim to reduce airway obstruction and improve airflow during sleep. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> As a non-invasive and potentially more comfortable approach, positional therapy may be particularly effective for patients whose OSA severity is strongly influenced by body position. However, its success varies widely among individuals depending on their anatomy, OSA severity, and sleeping habits. </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> The Night Shift Sleep Positioner (Fig. 7) is a clinically validated device designed to reduce positional OSA and snoring [21]. Worn either on the back of the neck or front of the chest, the device helps maintain a side-sleeping posture by gently correcting back-sleeping without disturbing sleep. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> When the user rolls onto their back during sleep, Night Shift emits a low-intensity vibration. If the position is not corrected, the vibration gradually intensifies until a postural shift occurs, typically without waking the user. For added comfort, the device offers a customisable start delay of 15 or 30 minutes, allowing users to fall asleep in their preferred position before therapy begins. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> In addition to positional therapy, Night Shift functions as a comprehensive sleep monitoring tool. It tracks a wide range of leep metrics, including sleep duration, snoring frequency, sleep efficacy, and night-time interruptions.

        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Despite their widespread availability and promotion, many of these products lack robust clinical evidence to support their efficacy in reducing AHI levels or reliably maintain a side-sleeping position. Although some users report subjective improvements in sleep comfort or snoring reduction, these pillows are best considered supplementary tools rather than standalone treatments for OSA. In many cases, they may offer comfort-related benefits (e.g. improved neck support, reduced joint pain), but do not replace more targeted or evidence-based interventions for positional OSA management. </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Our analysis reveals that the effectiveness of each treatment is closely tied to the severity of OSA. However, many treatments present concerns, such as high costs, invasiveness, or the need for significant lifestyle adjustments. Additionally, customisation is limited, which contributes to discomfort and ultimately low adherence. As a result, even clinically effective treatments may underperform if patients struggle to maintain consistent use. </p>

        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; font-size:18px;"> 3.1. Preliminary Study by Sengkang General Hospital </h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> To explore positional therapy as an alternative to traditional OSA treatments, the sleep team at SKH conducted a preliminary study involving 18 OSA patients. Participants underwent overnight PSG using a <b>U-shaped maternity pillow</b> to encourage side-sleeping. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> The pilot study found that the maternity pillow was <b>effective in maintaining side-sleeping positions and reducing OSA symptoms</b>, with many participants reporting generally positive experiences: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>61.1 percent</b> continued using the pillow at home after the study </li>
          <li><b>83.3 percent</b> said they would recommend it over CPAP to others </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> However, several participants raised concerns that revealed areas for improvement: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Pillow was too warm for prolonged use (<b>11.1 percent</b>) </li>
          <li> Pillow was too soft and lacked support (<b>5.6 percent</b>) </li>
          <li> Skin irritation due to the pillow cover (<b>5.6 percent</b>) </li>
          <li> Bulky design made it unsuitable for bed-sharing (<b>5.6 percent</b>) </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> These findings confirm that positional therapy – specifically using pregnancy pillows – can be effective, but also reveal key design limitations that hinder long-term adoption. </p>
      </div>

      <div id="section-3-2">
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; font-size:18px;"> 3.2. Problem Definition </h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> While the preliminary study demonstrated the potential of positional therapy as a non-invasive and comfortable alternative to traditional treatments, its limitations must be addressed before it can serve as a viable, widely adopted solution. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Commonly reported issues include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Reduced effectiveness in severe OSA cases</b>, where obstruction occurs regardless of sleeping position </li>
          <li><b>Lack of customisation</b>, making it hard to adapt to different body types and sleep preferences </li>
          <li><b>Discomfort during use</b>, which may ironically disrupt the quality of sleep they aim to improve </li>
          <li><b>Thermal discomfort</b>, especially with bulkier pillows or heat-retaining materials </li>
          <li><b>Space and usability issues</b>, particularly for users who share a bed </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Variations in user experience highlight the need for a better-designed positional therapy solution – one that balances effectiveness with comfort, adaptability, and ease of use. By addressing these pain points, we aim to design a solution that not only improves sleep posture but also enhances adherence and long-term health outcomes. </p>

      <div id="section-3-3">
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; font-size:18px;"> 3.3. Treatment Trade-Offs and Focus </h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> In weighing the limitations of existing treatment options, we identified a critical trade-off between effectiveness and user adherence. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> While CPAP therapy remains the gold standard in terms of clinical efficacy, its real-world success is often undermined by low patient adherence, driven by discomfort from wearing the mask, which is also bulky, noisy, and restrictive. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> In contrast, positional therapy, – particularly for patients whose OSA is exacerbated by back-sleeping – offers a non-invasive, more comfortable approach. Although not universally effective, its improved comfort presents an opportunity to design a solution that patients are more likely to adopt and consistently use. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: 16px;"> Given this context, this project focuses on developing a more user-centred positional therapy solution. While this narrows our target population, it allows us to address a significant unmet need within the current treatment landscape, potentially improving long-term outcomes for patients who are underserved by conventional options. </p>

      </div>

      <div id="section-4-1">
        <h3>4.1 Trade-Offs</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          When considering treatment options for OSA, there were significant trade-offs between different modalities. While CPAP therapy is proven to be highly effective for many patients, its widespread use is often hindered by low patient adherence. This is largely due to discomfort associated with wearing the mask, which can be bulky, noisy, and restrictive, making it challenging for patients to use consistently despite its effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          On the other hand, positional therapy, while not universally effective, offers a non-invasive solution with higher comfort levels, particularly for patients whose OSA is primarily exacerbated by back-sleeping. While positional therapy might not work for everyone, it presents an opportunity to create treatment that is comfortable and easier to use, ultimately leading to better adherence for specific groups of patients.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          In this project, we are focusing on this group of patients who benefit from positional therapy but require more user-friendly, comfortable, and customisable solutions. While this focus narrows our addressable market, we believe it allows us to address a critical gap in the current treatment landscape, offering substantial value in improving OSA management for those who struggle with conventional treatments.

        <h3>4.2 Persona</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          To better understand the needs of this target group, a persona was developed to guide the design of our solution.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
          “Meet Sarah, a 45-year-old woman diagnosed with mild to moderate OSA. Sarah’s OSA is most severe when she sleeps on her back, causing frequent snoring and disrupted sleep. She has tried CPAP therapy but struggled with the discomfort of wearing the mask, especially due to skin irritation and pressure on her face. Sarah wants a solution that is non-invasive, comfortable, and easy to use, but she finds most positional therapy pillows bulky, uncomfortable, or ineffective.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Sarah represents the type of patient who would benefit from a solution that addresses her needs of comfort, simplicity, and consistent use throughout the night. Her struggle with CPAP and limitations of existing positional therapy pillows highlight the need for a solution tailored to her requirements – a product that promotes side-sleeping without compromising effectiveness, comfort, or affordability.
        </p>

      <div id="section-4-3">
        <h3>4.3 Value Proposition Statement</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Our positional therapy solution provides targeted value for OSA patients (like Sarah) by addressing key gaps in existing treatment modalities:

        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/ValueProp.png" subtitle=" "></image-component>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Our solution aims to reduce OSA symptoms, enabling better sleep and overall improvements in health and well-being. By addressing discomfort, lack of customisation, and limited accessibility in existing treatments, we prioritise long-term adherence and patient satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Through enhancing positional sleep therapy options, we provide a balanced solution that is effective, comfortable, and accessible. This encourages consistent use, leading to better outcomes and a meaningful impact on patients’ quality of life.

        <h2>5 Design Strategy</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Our design strategy centres around creating a positional sleep therapy solution that addresses effectiveness and comfort for patients with OSA. We aim to develop a solution that helps patients maintain side-sleeping position, a key factor in reducing OSA symptoms. Recognising limitations of current solutions, our solution also seeks to be non-invasive and user-friendly, prioritising patient adherence and treatment effectiveness.

      <div id="section-5-1">
        <h3>5.1 Key Considerations</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Our design is based on two primary dimensions of sleep comfort that affect the likelihood of maintaining a side-sleeping position throughout the night (Table 5). By targeting these aspects, our design seeks to balance effectiveness with comfort, accessibility, and customisability.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/Table5.png" subtitle="Table 5: Dimensions of Sleep Comfort"></image-component>

      <div id="section-5-2">
        <h3>5.2 Prioritising Factors for Initial Design</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Given the wide range of factors influencing positional and thermal comfort, we have made simplifying assumptions to manage project complexity and timeline.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          We have decided to address factors one at a time through systematic prioritisation, with firmness as our focus for initial prototyping. Firmness directly impacts positional comfort and plays a central role in ensuring that patients remain in a side-sleeping position throughout the night. During the first round of design and prototyping, we will evaluate different firmness levels of the back bolster to identify the optimal level of support needed.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Once we establish the optimal firmness for the back bolster, we will shift focus to other factors, such as material selection, which will be tested for their thermal comfort properties. By focusing on firmness first, we aim to create a strong foundation for the positional comfort aspect of the design before moving on to other design parameters.

        <h2>6 Detailed Design</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Taking into consideration all design factors we have to test eventually, we decided to explore each factor systematically by isolating and evaluating them one at a time. This approach will allow us to observe the effect of each variable on both positional and thermal comfort, ensuring we are optimising each aspect individually before moving on to further iterations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <br />

      <div id="section-6-1">
        <h3>6.1 Simplifying Assumptions & Design Focus</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Due to the large number of variables involved, we are faced with a wide range of combinations for testing. Using firmness and material as an example, we have to test for 25 different combinations to obtain the optimal positional and thermal comfort for a user (Table 6). Each of these combinations will require extensive data collection over a few days, making the overall process very tedious.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/Table6.png" subtitle="Table 6: Testing Combinations for Two Factors"></image-component>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          To focus our efforts and streamline the development process, we made some simplifying assumption:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          Each factor (in Table 5) is solely tied to either positional comfort or thermal comfort, but not both.
        </li>
        <li>
          Different materials at the same firmness level yield similar positional comfort results. This allows us to first standardise the material and focus on exploring various firmness levels. Once the optimal firmness is identified, we can then explore different materials to optimise thermal comfort and refine the overall design.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          That said, in all our iterations, we will gather findings for both positional and thermal comfort to inform future improvements.

        <h3>6.2 Inspiration from Existing Solutions</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Our design draws inspiration from the pregnancy pillow previously tested by Sengkang Hospital (Figure 11). Since this pillow has shown to be effective in encouraging side-sleeping, it served as a model for our solution. We incorporated similar principles but enhanced the design to improve comfort, adjustability, and thermal regulation.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/Figure11.jpg" subtitle="Figure 11: Pregnancy Pillow" style="width:200px; height:auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></image-component>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Our solution includes a fixed shape and material for pillow components, with a standard pillow for head support, paired with front and back bolsters to provide additional support (Figure 12). This configuration makes use of familiar elements, which is likely to improve comfort and ease of use for patients.
        </p>

      <div id="section-6-3">
        <h3>6.3 Accessibility & Affordability</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Our design is cost-effective, ensuring the solution is affordable and accessible to a wide range of patients. Users will only need to purchase the bolsters if they do not already have them, which reduces the overall financial burden. By keeping costs low, we aim to increase patient compliance (for our research) and ensure that a broader range of patients can benefit from this solution.

      <div id="section-7-1">
        <h3>7.1 Initial Prototyping & Firmness Testing</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          To begin our initial prototyping and testing, we needed a basic bolster to serve as our starting point. Once the bolsters arrived, we conducted a firmness test on each one (Figure 13). Our goal was to create a quantifiable scale across five distinct firmness levels, which we would then use to evaluate user comfort and the effectiveness of positional support.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/Figure13.png" subtitle="Figure 13: Firmness Test Procedure" style="width:300px; height:auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></image-component>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Currently, we are in the process of testing these firmness levels across three different test subjects, with the aim of understanding how firmness alone affects both effectiveness and comfort.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="section-7-2">
        <h3>7.2 Securing the Bolsters for Positional Stability</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Ensuring consistent positional support was critical as the bolsters needed to stay in place during sleep without rolling away. Hence, we designed a system to secure the front and back bolsters together. Our solution used a velcro and cloth loop mechanism (Figure 14), allowing the bolsters to ‘hug’ the body comfortably and prevent unwanted movement during sleep, keeping the user in a side-sleeping position.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/Figure14.png" subtitle="Figure 14: Bolster Setup" style="width:700px; height:auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></image-component>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          This approach was inspired by the design of pregnancy pillows which features a connecting structure that stabilises support points and was chosen for its simplicity and user-friendliness. The loops for each bolster are connected by a strip of cloth, keeping them securely in place while being easy to attach and remove as needed.

        <h3>7.3 Data Collection: Sensor-Based Monitoring</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          To accurately monitor and record the sleep posture of our test subjects, we used the MetaMotionRL (Figure 15), a wearable device that offers real-time, continuous monitoring of motion data. This device captures the frequency and range of motion, allowing us to determine if our design effectively encourages side-sleeping.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          The sensor was worn on the subject’s chest area (and taped down using any tape) to provide a stable reference point for detecting body position shifts (Figure 16). For optimal alignment, the charging port faced downward, ensuring consistent orientation and accurate data collection.

        <h3>7.4 User Feedback: Qualitative Comfort Assessment</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          In addition to quantitative data from the sensor, we recognised the importance of capturing subjective experience of comfort, as it can vary from user to user. We thus created a survey to gather user feedback on their comfort levels after each sleep session with the bolsters. Participants rated their positional comfort and thermal comfort on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 represented the least comfort and 5 represented the most comfort. This allowed us to capture how users perceived their experience with different firmness levels and how perceived temperature affected their comfort.

      <div id="section-7-5">
        <h3>7.5 Data Collected: Positional Comfort</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Several data were captured by the MetaMotionRL sensor (Figure 17), but the primary metric for assessing positional comfort was pitch angle, which measures the side-to-side tilt of the body. By focusing on this metric, we tracked whether users remained on their sides or shifted to their backs while sleeping. This was critical in determining the effectiveness of the bolster in maintaining the desired side-sleeping position.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/Figure17.png" subtitle="Figure 17: Data captured by MetaMotionRL Sensor" style="width:600px; height:auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></image-component>

          Data collected so far has been summarised in Figure 18, which shows percentage side lying across the baseline (no back bolster) and each of the five firmness levels (Firmness 1 to Firmness 5) tested. This plot provides an overview of how the bolsters are performing in terms of encouraging side-sleeping.

        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Currently, we are in the process of testing the five firmness levels across three test subjects, with data collection ongoing. In the final box plot, we expect that baseline (without any back bolster) will form the control group, showing natural side-sleeping support. The most firm back support (Firmness 1) is expected to have the highest percentage side lying (close to 100 percent), indicating effective side-sleeping support. As firmness decreases from Firmness 1 to 5 (where there is minimal support), we expect percentage side lying to decrease, eventually returning to baseline levels (Figure 19).
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          These insights will guide our next steps in optimising bolster firmness and materials, allowing us to refine the design for improved comfort and support.

        <h2>8 Limitations & Future Plans</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          While the current prototyping phase has provided valuable insights into the impact of firmness on side-sleeping comfort, several limitations must be considered. First, the data collection process is still ongoing, with only preliminary results available from the five firmness levels tested across three test subjects. The sample size is limited, and further testing across a broader demographic is necessary to ensure the generalisability of the findings.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Additionally, we have yet to explore how other factors (e.g. shape, material) affect side-sleeping comfort. While firmness plays a central role, the interaction between positional and thermal comfort is likely to be more complex. These factors will be addressed in future iterations of the design, aiming to create a more holistic and comfortable solution for users.
